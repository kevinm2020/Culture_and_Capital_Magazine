# New Releases Friday – Recap  
*May 16, 2025*

As time moves forward, the heat rises and settles. Summer will be here before we know it. And with every summer comes the prestigious Olympic sport of **“Song of the Summer.”**

This Friday, we’ve got some new, exciting releases. I like to think of these songs as tryouts for that title. Without further ado, here are the top 3 tracks that caught my ear:

## “One Thing” – Lola Young (Indie/Pop)

I’ve been a Lola Young fan for a while. I indulged in her first EP, *My Mind Wanders and Sometimes Leaves Completely* (2023), where her voice felt fresh, and her lyrics made it clear she’s just like the rest of us depressed, horny freaks trying to figure out love, sex, and life.

Her early sound was very “Debut Billie Eilish”—confessional, depressive, young. But with her 2023 follow-up *This Wasn’t Meant For You Anyway*, Lola started shifting: she began exploring power dynamics, especially the way she had often been in submissive roles in relationships.

Then came the viral moment with *Messy*, followed by a feature with Tyler, The Creator (*Like Him*, 2024), and now she’s opening for fellow sad girl Billie Eilish. She’s grown—in career, confidence, and control.

Enter *One Thing*. It’s Lola at her most confident, cheeky, sexy, spicy—and in demand of one thing only: her pleasure.

The song starts with a groovy, tropical bassline—oddly Caribbean for a very British artist—which I think is what made it go semi-viral as a meme. It reminded me of that photo of Adele in Bantu knots and a Jamaican bikini at Notting Hill Carnival.

By the first verse, Lola dominates the track just like she dominates the love interest she sings to. The song is catchy, no doubt. It’s the combination of lyrical honesty, cheeky vocals, and her evolving image that makes it special. It makes me want to hook up with a hot guy this summer, break his bed, and never call him again.

**Prediction:** Possible virality à la *Messy*. Still a bit obscure to the mainstream, so maybe Bottom 50 of Billboard for now.

## “Friend of Mine” – Rihanna

What the fuck? There’s a new Rihanna song. And a new Smurf movie. Honestly, those two things in the same sentence are what make this track’s existence feel so absurd. But absurd in a fun way.

And that’s what we need right now: fun. Not high-concept, not overproduced—just dumb, cringy, fun.

I worked an 18-hour shift at a restaurant today. It was hell. But this song? It genuinely put a smile on my face.

So what does a Rihanna x Smurf soundtrack song sound like?

Describing it in Rihanna eras: it leans toward *Good Girl Gone Bad*—not quite bad girl, but still flirty and danceable. Sonically, it’s got an Afrobeat/tribal pop vibe. It reminds me of Shakira’s *Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)* from the 2010 World Cup.

But being a Rihanna track, there’s also club-pop DNA all over it. I wouldn’t be surprised if we end up dancing to this in clubs—a Smurf song on the aux at 2am would be hilarious and iconic.

Still, early internet reactions weren’t kind. Fans complained her vocals were barely present—or worse, weak. She sings the same verse repeatedly, which sparked rumors: did Rihanna mail this in for a check? Is her voice in decline?

Maybe. But who cares? It’s dumb, fun, and weirdly catchy.

**Prediction:** Top 50 Billboard. With the movie push, we’ll hear it. Let’s see how 2025 Rihanna performs.

## “What I Want” – Morgan Wallen & Tate McRae

Okay, this one surprised me—it’s not bad.

You’d assume it would be trash. Country? Morgan Wallen? But country has been creeping up for a while. It’s part of this cultural shift where “American identity” and nostalgia are back in demand, especially with the rise of conservatism in pop culture.

It’s not traditional country. It’s palatable, streamable country-pop. Cowboy Carter, *A Bar Song*, Chappell Roan, Benson Boone—they’re all subverting the genre.

I had never really listened to Morgan Wallen before. (I’m too gay—I stay in the pop lane.) But I do remember the controversies around him. Still, I was… intrigued. He’s got that bad-boy, edgy, all-American swagger. A bad boy with a sensitive side and “good heart deep down” like that say in the movies. A perfect Trojan Country in a digestible pop romantic figure.  And that’s what this song is. A bad boy meets a bad girl. Toxic. Seductive. Makes you wonder what bad things you’d do too.

Okay—enough thirst.

The song itself is catchy and dumb in the best way. Tate McRae is the queen of catchy dumb pop, and this collab was a smart move. Of course, McRae caught some heat for working with Wallen. But she probably knew the song would hit too hard for the haters to ignore.

**Prediction:** Top 25 Billboard. This is another *A Bar Song (Tipsy)* type of hit waiting to happen.
