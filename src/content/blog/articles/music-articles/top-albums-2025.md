# Top Albums of 2025 (January – May 15)
*By: K.M | May 15, 2025*

2024 was one of the biggest years in music. This time last year, we were swimming in highly anticipated drops — *Cowboy Carter*, *Hit Me Hard and Soft*, *Eternal Sunshine*, *Short n' Sweet*, *Charm*, *Brat*. If 2024 was the raging, euphoric house party, 2025 is the hangover: dry-mouthed and broke.

Last summer, we were snorting Charli XCX off the back of a party pass and dancing away our dread of elections and international doom. But now? New president. Trade war. Vibes in absolute disarray. 

So what’s the music sounding like in this, our Year of the Comedown™?

## JANUARY

**Jan 5 – Bad Bunny: _Debi Tirar Mas Flores_ (Reggaeton)**  
Didn’t listen. Couldn’t care. After *Un Verano Sin Ti*, Benito's magic fizzled. I assumed lash techs and hot Cheeto girlies would go feral — but they didn’t. The man lost his aura somewhere between Kendall Jenner and corporate PR. If pressing play on your album sounds exhausting, that’s a review in itself.

**Jan 22 – FKA Twigs: _Eusexua_ (Avant-pop, techno)**  
I was *Stan excited* for this one. I tweeted. I set alarms. This album is a **concept**, and Twigs *did* that.  
She gave us a whole-ass fictional word (*Eusexua*) and a liberatory sonic world where fun, horny devils roam free. *Drums of Death* and *Room of Fools*? Unholy slaps.  

But like a sparkler at midnight, it fizzled too fast. No shame — some albums are comets, not bonfires.

**Jan 31 – The Weeknd: _Hurry Up Tomorrow_ (R&B, synth-pop)**  
Did not listen. Why? Because every time I think of The Weeknd now, I think of that video of him fake-fellating a mic. Or that cursed tweet: *“I'm going to find you, then I'm going to fuck you...”* and his performance in HBO's The Idol.Ew.  

This is not the energy I want in 2025.  
The music? Probably genius. The brand? Cringe horn-dog.

## FEBRUARY

**Feb 7 – Oklou: _Choke Enough_ (Synth pop, bedroom pop)**  
If you’re not gay or chronically online, this one may have slipped past you. It had a cult moment — a gentle digital flash flood.

At first? Confused.  
After looping *Take Me By the Hand* feat. Bladee? Converted.

This is anti-maximalism. Quiet, restrained, peaceful French sonic minimalism in a world that won’t shut up. Weird at first. Soothing after.

**Feb 21 – Tate McRae: _So Close to What_ (Pop, R&B)**  
Tate's the girl who (somehow) had more Spotify listeners than Beyoncé. Internet said “who?” and then streamed *Greedy* and *Exes* until we gave in.  

*It’s ok I’m ok* is a banger. So is *Revolving Door*. She’s got the stickiest pop.

But some of these tracks? Straight filler. Fries without the burger.

## MARCH

**Mar 7 – Lady Gaga: _Mayhem_ (Pop)**  
Whew. So much promise.

We started with *Disease* — twisted, vulnerable, promising a new dark Gaga. Then came *Abracadabra* at the Super Bowl. The tease! The edge! The anticipation!  
And then... *Mayhem*. Or as the timeline dubbed it: *Meh-hem*.

Where was the impact? The club plays? The cultural shift?  

It wasn’t bad. But for Gaga? “Not bad” is an underperformance. We expected *Brat* levels of domination. Instead, we got one pregame bop before 10 p.m.

This will get awards. But not replayed.

**Honorable Mentions**:  
- Playboi Carti – *Music*  
- Kanye West – *Bully V1*  
- Selena Gomez & Benny Blanco – *I Said I Love You First*  
- Perfume Genius – *Glory*

## APRIL

Pop took a nap.

**Un-Honorable Mentions**:  
- Skrillex  
- Wiz Khalifa  
- Snoop Dogg  

Total Snoozefest.

## MAY

**May 9 – Pink Pantheress: _Fancy That_**  
Gen Z royalty. From TikTok baddie to legitimate tastemaker. The rollout gave us *Tonight* and *Stateside* — both hits, with *Tonight* earning its own TikTok dance.

She’s mastered the stylish, Y2K, micro-skirt-pop energy.  
This album? No skips. All vibes. *Illegal* opens with a sample from 90s British techno and sets the scene — we’re in some illegal rave in Essex, dancing with a pint in one hand and trauma in the other.

It’s Pink at her most *British*. Cohesive. Club-ready. Genius.

**Honorable Mentions**:  
- Kali Uchis – *Sincerely*

## Upcoming We’re Hyped For:

- **May 30** – Miley Cyrus: *Something Beautiful*  
- **June 5** – Addison Rae: *Addison*  
- **June 20** – Benson Boone: *American Heart*  
- **June 27** – Lorde: *Virgin*

## Final Thoughts

2025 may have started slow, but summer’s here. Our brains are overheating. Our bodies are ready to dance again.  

Will it top the chaos of 2024? Probably not.  
Will we try anyway? Absolutely.

Stay tuned with **Adverse** — we’ll keep you locked into the sound of the culture.
